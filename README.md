# CNN-based-blood-cell-detection
Using  YOLO CNN for blood cell detection 
There are many types of pretrained model that been
implemented in any machine learning architecture. Models
like Alexnet, VGG16, and Darknet that had been trained with
Imagenet and the weight is kept and ready to use for future
implementation. Most of these models are CNN based

We make use of pretrained weights from YOLO with custom blood cell dataset and build the following net
An important problem in blood diagnostics is classifying different types of blood cells. 
Here we have 410 original images and 12,500 augmented images of blood cells paired with subtype labels.
We want to automatically classify each image according to the subtype of cells within it.
